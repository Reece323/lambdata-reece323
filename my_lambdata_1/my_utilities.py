        This function is a utility wrapper around the Scikit-Learn train_test_split that splits arrays or 
        matrices into train, validation, and test subsets.
        Args:
            X (Numpy array or DataFrame): This is a dataframe with features.
            y (Numpy array or DataFrame): This is a pandas Series with target.
            train_size (float or int): Proportion of the dataset to include in the train split (0 to 1).
            val_size (float or int): Proportion of the dataset to include in the validation split (0 to 1).
            test_size (float or int): Proportion of the dataset to include in the test split (0 to 1).
            random_state (int): Controls the shuffling applied to the data before applying the split for reproducibility.
            shuffle (bool): Whether or not to shuffle the data before splitting
        Returns:
            Train, test, and validation dataframes for features (X) and target (y).
